tow approaches for handing task 
  the first one 
    step 1: create all the task in one map with id 
    step 2: create a felid in user with the task id 

    step 3: check the user login every time and call the all task and then filter them with respect to user 


   the second one 
     step 1: same separation as earlier  but take will be maped this time with respect to user id like 
     {userid1: [
      all the task of that respective user
     ]}  this will be the task with store like a map not maps of task
